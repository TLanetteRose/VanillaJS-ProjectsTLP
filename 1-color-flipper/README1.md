# Project 1: Color Flipper

## JavaScript Skills in Tutorial:
- Arrays
- For Loop
- Math.floor and Math.random
- Functions

## What I Learned from the Project
This project was a great review for writing functions and using a For loop. I learned how to generate a random function that chose 6 numbers/characters randomly to generate a hex color code. I could use this skill for changing the color themes on pages.
