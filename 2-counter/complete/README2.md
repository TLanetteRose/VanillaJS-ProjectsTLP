## What I Learned from the Project
This project involved making a  counter with buttons that would decrease, increase, and reset when pushed. The decreased numbers would be in red, and the increase numbers would be in green. I learned how to set up the forEach method with the eventlistener for the buttons. I also learned how to set the color for each button using the count to compare to numbers above, below, and equal to zero.
